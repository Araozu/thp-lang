# THP: Typed Hypertext Processor

Types and a new syntax for PHP, because I'm forced to use it at work.

## Usage

### Singular files

Inside an existing PHP codebase, files are converted to THP
one at a time, or new files are written in THP.

There must be a thp.config.yaml at the root of the project,
which configures the compiler.

Every file is compiled in place.


### Project mode

The whole project uses THP. Work in progress.
